    "question": "What are the core values of SAFe, and how do they align with large-scale development challenges?",
    "answer": "The core values of SAFe are Alignment, Built-in Quality, Transparency, and Program Execution. These values ensure that large-scale organizations stay focused on common goals, maintain high-quality outcomes, and foster clear communication across all levels of the organization.",
    "tags": ["SAFe", "Core Values"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain how SAFe addresses the challenges of scaling Agile in large organizations. What key practices or levels are critical to its success?",
    "answer": "SAFe addresses scaling challenges by introducing four levels: Team, Program, Large Solution, and Portfolio. Key practices include Agile Release Trains (ARTs) for synchronization, Program Increment (PI) Planning for alignment, and cadence-based delivery to manage dependencies.",
    "tags": ["SAFe", "Scaling Challenges"]
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key differences between SAFe and LeSS in their approach to scaling Agile?",
    "answer": "SAFe uses a structured, hierarchical approach with multiple levels and defined roles (e.g., RTE, Solution Architect). LeSS focuses on decentralization, simplicity, and self-organization with a single Product Backlog and one Product Owner for all teams.",
    "tags": ["SAFe", "LeSS", "Comparison"]
  },
  {
    "question": "How does SAFe ensure alignment across multiple teams working on the same product or solution?",
    "answer": "SAFe ensures alignment through Agile Release Trains (ARTs), Program Increment (PI) Planning, Portfolio-level Epics and value streams, and synchronized cadence-based planning across all teams.",
    "tags": ["SAFe", "Alignment"]
  },
  {
    "question": "In LeSS, how is coordination between multiple teams achieved without adding unnecessary complexity?",
    "answer": "LeSS achieves coordination through a single Product Backlog managed by one Product Owner, Sprint Planning 1 for cross-team alignment, Sprint Planning 2 for team-specific tasks, and Scrum of Scrums for regular collaboration.",
    "tags": ["LeSS", "Coordination"]
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main challenges organizations face when adopting SAFe, and how can they address them effectively?",
    "answer": "Challenges include complexity, resistance to change, and upfront investment. These can be addressed with strong leadership support, comprehensive training, and starting with a pilot Agile Release Train (ART) to gradually introduce SAFe practices.",
    "tags": ["SAFe", "Adoption Challenges"]
  },
  {
    "question": "How does LeSS ensure that teams remain autonomous while working on a large-scale product?",
    "answer": "LeSS ensures autonomy by allowing teams to self-organize during Sprint Planning 2 while aligning on shared goals in Sprint Planning 1. Teams communicate directly and avoid hierarchical interference, maintaining decentralized decision-making.",
    "tags": ["LeSS", "Autonomy"]
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key success factors for adopting SAFe in a large organization?",
    "answer": "Key success factors include leadership support, comprehensive training, clear roles, effective Program Increment (PI) Planning, and starting with a pilot Agile Release Train (ART) to build confidence and refine practices.",
